<p>With 7 years of experience in development, I began my career as a WordPress developer before transitioning into full-stack developer. My expertise lies in Angular and React, and I have expanded my skills to include game development and backend frameworks. I have contributed to a variety of projects, collaborating with teams to build innovative and high-performance solutions. Passionate about both gaming and software development, I am eager to continue growing, tackling new challenges, and making a meaningful impact through my work
